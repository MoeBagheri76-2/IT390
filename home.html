			<h1>Problem</h1>
			<p>Managing a budget is something that is done anywhere from a weekly basis to a monthly basis. Budgeting involves having to go through 
			all your credit card transactions, bills, debit card transactions, spent cash and all other necessary information. All that information 
			then has to be recorded and organized. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The budgeting process is very time-consuming and something many people do not like to do. There are budgeting tools, but most require 
			entering your data manually. Organizing all that information is also not easy and very time-consuming.</p>
			<br>
			<h1>Solution: Budget Planner</h1>
			<p>My solution is a tool that automates budget record keeping and organization. All transactions from credit cards and debit cards, 
			checking and savings accounts, investments, loans, and other data is automatically collected from the user’s accounts. Then the data 
			will be organized automatically into categories that the user can either personalize or use the standard categories. Daily/Weekly/Monthly 
			reports can be viewed at any time.
			<br>
			<br>
			Not all information that is required for the budget process can be collected automatically. For example, information such as cash spendings, 
			paper bills, and other information cannot be collected automatically. Users will be able to manually enter necessary information that cannot 
			be collected automatically. The manually entered data will then be organized automatically.</p>
