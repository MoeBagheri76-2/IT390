			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is David Kim. I am a senior at George Mason University expected to graduate Spring of 2023. 
			I am an IT major with a concentration in Database Technology and Programming. On my free time I like to fish, 
			hike, watch movies/shows, and playing games. My idea for this application came from my hatred for budgeting. 
			I do it on a monthly basis and dread it. My goal is to make budgeting as easy and quick as possible.. </p>
