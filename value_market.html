			<h1>Value/Market</h1>
			<p>No one likes to budget. It is a tedious and time-consuming process, but with inflation on the rise budgeting has never been more important. 
			As someone who goes through that process monthly, an application like this would be a massive time saver. It will make budgeting so much easier 
			as well. You will only have to enter a few extra pieces of data each month and everything is automated.
			<br>
			<br>
			A similar application, called Mint, has approximately 20 million users (<a href="https://investorjunkie.com/reviews/mint-com/">source</a>). 
			The global accounting & budgeting software market was valued at $16.85 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $47.97 billion by 2031 
			(<a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/accounting-&-budgeting-software-market-A17180">source</a>). Based on the data, there is a 
			large market for budgeting software.</p>

			<h1>Competitor: Mint</h1>
			<p>Their Solution: This application first syncs with the users checking and savings accounts, credit cards, loans investments and bills. It then 
			tracks all expenses and puts them into categories that can be personalized but is limited to a certain amount of categories.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our Competitive Advantage: One advantage the Budget Planner has is the ability to create as many categories as wanted. Another is the ability to 
			track income and not only expenses. It is also free and ad free!</p>
